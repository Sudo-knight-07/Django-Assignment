Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. This means that if the caller's database operations are wrapped in a transaction, 
the signal handlers will also participate in the same transaction context.

Example Code:

from django.db import models, transaction
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_receiver(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal receiver executed.")
    # Intentionally raise an exception to cause a rollback
    raise Exception("Error in signal receiver")

from django.db import transaction

try:
    with transaction.atomic():
        MyModel.objects.create(name="Test Instance")
        print("Model instance saved.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Transaction failed: {e}")

# Check if the instance was saved
print("Number of instances in the database:", MyModel.objects.count())




Expected Output:

Model instance saved.
Signal receiver executed.
Transaction failed: Error in signal receiver
Number of instances in the database: 0
